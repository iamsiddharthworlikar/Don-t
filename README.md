# Don-t
Don't play with her, don't be dishonest Still not understanding this logic
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killing the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Get in the ride
Left hand is steering the other is gripping your thigh
